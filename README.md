# Apex Sublime Syntax

This project is a WIP Sublime syntax file for the [Salesforce Apex language](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexref.meta/apexref/apex_ref_guide.htm).

It inherits rules from the `Java.sublime-syntax` file with adaptations and is highlighting Apex code well enough so far.

## Installation

A plugin package does not exist yet on [packagecontrol.io/](https://packagecontrol.io), so in the meantime you have to install it manually into your `sublime-text/Packages/Apex` folder.
